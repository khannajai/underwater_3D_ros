# May need to be performed with vehicle stationary due to computation time.
# May be useful to provide constraints on odometry whilst localising, e.g. at least 
# estimate visual motion every second, to speed up localisation calculations. 
# Could slow/stop vehicle during this process. Potential to specify pose
